# Hardware/Network/Operating System Gallery Walk

These are the guidlines for this task.

1. **Walk** around to the different websites and when there record 1 thing you learnt about Terminology annd one thing about Functionality.
2. Once you have learnt 2 things at the website write down your name on the yellow library card at that station.
3. If you get to a station and 3 names have already been written down, you are still encouraged to learn at that station but you **may not**
use that station to fill out your learning record.
4. Once you have completely filled out your sheet or the instructor has determined that it is time to move on then:

- Go back to your computer(assuming no one is in the process of learning at your station) and find your repository with your website.
- Create a Log.md file in that repository and write a brief reflection(1-2 paragraphs) about the learning that occured throughout this activity.

This will conclude our work with project.

Thank you for your participation!
